    <h1>P5 experiments</h1>
    <p>
        I'm playing with P5 to see if I can make some interesting things as part of <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2024</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Probability Toy</h2>
    <p>
      This simulates a demo toy I've seen that drops hundreds of balls into a grid of pins, and they fall into a bell curve.
      Running demo <a href="probtoy/">here</a>. Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/probtoy">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Particles</h2>
    <p>
      This is a particle experiment. Each particle is thrown at a random angle, and when it hits the wall, it sticks. If it hits a stuck particle, it sticks.
      The particle chains grow in interesting ways. It clears and restarts whenever it gets full.
      Running demo <a href="particles/">here</a>. Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/particles2">here</a>.
