          <h1>P5 experiments</h1>
          <p>
            In 2024 I started playing with <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5</a> to
            see if I could make some interesting things as part of <a
            href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary</a>. The P5 system seems to work
            pretty well on mobile and I've been able to accomplish a lot. Now
            I'm continuing the project in 2025. All of these sketches are tested
            on my Mac desktop and my iPhone.
