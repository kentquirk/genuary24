    <h1>P5 experiments</h1>
    <p>
        I'm playing with P5 to see if I can make some interesting things as part of <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2024</a>.
        This stuff seems to work pretty well on mobile.
    </p>
    <h2>Genuary 13 (Wobbly function day)</h2>
    <h3>Seven Deadly Sines</h3>
    <p>
      This project combines seven sine wave generators at different frequencies to make one smoothly evolving image.
      It uses the basic concept of Lissajous figures but uses dots instead of continuous lines, and
      modifies colors and dot sizes dynamically too.
      Running demo <a href="sevenDeadlySines/">here</a>.
      Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/sevenDeadlySines">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Genuary 12 (lava lamp)</h2>
    <h3>Not a Lavalamp</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to create a lavalamp by doing a physics simulation of a mesh of points under
      various forces. I played with using a concave hull library to create the shape around
      the collection of points, and also with using a Voronoi diagram to create a mesh and
      then adding some weird spring-like forces to try to keep the mesh together. I had more
      fun playing with that and never bothered to finish making it look like a lavalamp.
      Running demo <a href="lavalamp/">here</a>.

    </p>
    <h2>Genuary 8 (chaotic)</h2>
    <h3>Kaotik</h3>
    <p>
      This is a simulation of rabbits and wolves in an ecosystem. The rabbits eat the grass,
      the wolves eat the rabbits, and the wolves die if they don't eat enough rabbits.
      There populations fluctuate chaotically. Running demo <a href="kaotik/">here</a>.
      Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/kaotic">here</a>.

    <h2>Genuary 4 (Pixels) & 6 (Screensaver)</h2>
    <h3>Pixasplode</h3>
    <p>
      This loads a picture, draws it as circular pixels in random order, and then gives each pixel
      a weak velocity dependent on the hue of the pixel. It's a fairly pleasing way to blow up the
      image. Running demo <a href="pixasplode/">here</a>.
      Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/pixasplode">here</a>.

    <h2>Genuary 3 - The Droste Effect</h2>
    <h3>Zooming in on "microbes"</h3>
    <p>
      The Droste Effect is when an image contains a smaller version of itself;
      in this case what I was after was that you're looking at microbes through
      a microscope, and you see them float onscreen. You move the slide to
      center one of them, zoom in, and find that the microbe contains more
      microbes.
    </p>
    <p>It's not perfect but I like it.</p>

        Big fleas have little fleas<br />
        Upon their backs to bite 'em<br />
        And little fleas still lesser fleas<br />
        And so, <i>ad infinitum</i><br />

    <h2>Genuary 2 - No Palette</h2>
    <h3>Random Grid of Colors</h3>
    <p>
      This creates an array of rectangles starting with one that covers the
      whole canvas, colored randomly. Each round, it chooses a random rectangle
      and splits it into two rectangles either horizontally or vertically. Each
      of these new rectangles is then recolored with a variation of the previous
      color by choosing either r, g, or b from the parent rectangle. Then one
      half adds to that value (lightening it), and the other subtracts from it
      (darkening it). The other two components of the color are kept constant.
      The colors fade from the starting value to the target value over time.
      When the grid gets too dense, it clears and starts over. Running demo <a
      href="nopalette/">here</a>. Source code <a

    <h2>Genuary 1 - Particles</h2>
    <h3>Probability Toy</h3>
    <p>
      This simulates a demo toy I've seen that drops hundreds of balls into a grid of pins, and they fall into a bell curve.
      Running demo <a href="probtoy/">here</a>. Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/probtoy">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Particles</h3>
    <p>
      This is a particle experiment. Each particle is thrown at a random angle, and when it hits the wall, it sticks. If it hits a stuck particle, it sticks.
      The particle chains grow in interesting ways. It clears and restarts whenever it gets full.
      Running demo <a href="particles2/">here</a>. Source code <a href="https://github.com/kentquirk/genuary24/tree/main/p5/particles2">here</a>.
