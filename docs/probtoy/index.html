    <h1>Probability Toy</h1>
    <p>
      This simulates a toy that contains hundreds of little balls and a bunch of pins, plus some slots
      to catch them all. The balls are dropped from the top and bounce around, eventually falling into
      the slots. The result should be close to a normal distribution (bell curve).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the physical toy it's quite close.
      It's not quite a normal distribution in this simulation, which I think is probably related
      to errors in the physics simulation.
