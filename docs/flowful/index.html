		<h1>Flowful</h1>
    <p>
      This is a flow field simulation, and the flows rotate in synchrony. The
      particles are affected the flow field, and their color indicates their
      mass (red is the lightest, yellow is the heaviest). As the field rotates,
      the particles change their behavior in interesting ways. The system has both
      random and circular fields, and you can switch between them with the controls.
