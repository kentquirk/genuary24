    <h1>Random grid of colors</h1>
    <p>
      This creates an array of rectangles starting with one that covers the
      whole canvas, colored randomly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round, it chooses a random rectangle and splits it into two
      rectangles either horizontally or vertically. Each of these new rectangles
      is then recolored with a variation of the previous color by choosing
      either r, g, or b from the parent rectangle. Then one half adds to that
      value (lightening it), and the other subtracts from it (darkening it). The
      other two components of the color are kept constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colors fade from the starting value to the target value over time. When the
      grid gets too dense, it clears and starts over.
    </p>
